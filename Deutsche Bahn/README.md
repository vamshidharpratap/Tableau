As a part of Tableau learning, I have created an interactive Dashboard on Deutsche Bahn train data using Tableau.<br/>
The dataset was taken from Kaggle which was captured from trains and travels in different stations of Germany.<br/>
I have performed pre-processing and merging all individual city data files using Python and Excel.<br/>
The DBHAN.zip file is the initial unprocessed dataset. <br/>
